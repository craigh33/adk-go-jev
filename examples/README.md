# Examples

Set the TypeSafe environment variables before running an example:

```bash
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY='...'
export TYPESAFE_BASE_URL='https://api.typesafe.ai'
```

`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is required. `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL` is optional and defaults to `https://api.typesafe.ai`; provide the API root without `/v1/systemone`. Each example passes these values to the client options.

- [typesafe-evaluate](typesafe-evaluate): evaluate structured state directly with Choice, Score, and Noul.
- [systemone-tool](systemone-tool): attach an application-configured System One tool to an ADK agent.
- [bedrock-routing](bedrock-routing): route tickets to Bedrock-backed agents with confidence fallback.
- [systemone-assessment](systemone-assessment): assess model input, output, and tool calls.
- [evaluation](evaluation): run labelled routing evaluations.

Each example has its own setup instructions, including any additional provider credentials. Run commands from the repository root unless the example says otherwise.
